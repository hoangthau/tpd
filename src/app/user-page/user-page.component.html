  <p>Why is it that some people live the life theyâ€™ve always dreamed of, while others watch from the sidelines as their own dreams gather dust? Is it luck, or an elusive quality that only some people are born with? Neither. Everything you need to live your own dream is contained between the pages of a simple book.</p>
  <p>Do the thing. You will have the power.</p>
